.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#] The italicized type that follows the name is the type of the
       argument passed as the ``value`` parameter to
       ``xiaBoardOperation()``. The special type "none" indicates that
       the board operation does not require nor return any data via
       ``value`` and a non-null, dummy variable should be passed in.

.. [#] Board operations annotated with "mapping" require that mapping
       mode be enabled when doing the operation. If mapping mode is
       not enabled an error is returned.
